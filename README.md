Udemy ESLint Packages
=====================

This repository has [*ESLint*](https://www.github.com/eslint/eslint) related packages used by various Udemy projects. 
It is owned by [@udemy/team-f](https://github.com/orgs/udemy/teams/team-f), but everyone is welcome to contribute.
Please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section to learn more.

This repository uses [*Lerna*](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage multiple [*npm*](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages. We 
configured Lerna to use [*Yarn Workspaces*](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) under the hood.

# Installation

Refer to each package's *Installation* section in order to learn how to install each package.
There is no top-level installation. Though, [`eslint-config-udemy-basics`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-basics)
and [`eslint-plugin-udemy`](packages/eslint-plugin-udemy) are good starting points.

# Commands

In order to contribute to this repository, you need to have a basic understanding of 
[Lerna commands](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#commands). In a nutshell, 
there are three important commands to know:

* **[`lerna add`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#add):** In order to add a new dependency to an existing package's 
`package.json` file, you'd run `` `yarn bin`/lerna add dependency-name --scope=package-name``. E.g.:
    
    ```
    $ `yarn bin`/lerna add eslint-plugin-lodash --scope=eslint-config-udemy-website
    ``` 
    
* **[`lerna bootstrap`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#bootstrap):** In order to install all of the dependencies
for every package, you can simply run `` `yarn bin`/lerna bootstrap``.
* **[`lerna publish`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#publish):** In order to publish your changes to npm, you
can simply run `` `yarn bin`/lerna publish ``. It will prompt you for a version number for each package you have 
changed.

# List of available packages

We individually publish all folders inside [`packages`](packages) as a separate npm package. These packages are
owned by our [Udemy npm organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/udemy).

* **[`eslint-config-udemy-basics`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-basics):** A basic ESLint configuration for writing 
ES2015 JavaScript code. This is used by various Udemy projects.
* **[`eslint-config-udemy-babel-addons`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-babel-addons):** 
[*Babel*](https://github.com/babel/babel) specific ESLint configuration. Extended by 
[`eslint-config-udemy-website`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-website).
* **[`eslint-config-udemy-jasmine-addons`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-jasmine-addons):** 
[*Jasmine*](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) specific ESLint configuration. Extended by 
[`eslint-config-udemy-website`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-website).
* **[`eslint-config-udemy-react-addons`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-react-addons):**
[*React*](https://github.com/facebook/react) specific ESLint configuration. Extended by 
[`eslint-config-udemy-website`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-website).
* **[`eslint-config-udemy-website`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-website):**
The ESLint configuration used by 
[`udemy/website-django/static/`](https://github.com/udemy/website-django/tree/master/static/.eslintrc.js) codebase.
* **[`eslint-plugin-udemy`](packages/eslint-plugin-udemy):**
A set of custom ESLint rules written for Udemy, by Udemy. These rules are mainly used by  
[`eslint-config-udemy-website`](packages/eslint-config-udemy-website).

# Contributing

Install [*Yarn v1.3.2*](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases/tag/v1.3.2) globally. 

    $ npm install -g yarn@1.3.2
    
<small>**Note:** Since our main `udemy/website-django` codebase
uses a different Yarn version at the moment (v0.22), you might want to utilize 
[*nvm*](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to maintain multiple Yarn versions. E.g. use 
`nvm use system && npm install -g yarn@0.22` for `udemy/website-django`, and 
`nvm install 6.10.1 && nvm use 6.10.1 && npm install -g yarn@1.3.2` for `udemy/eslint-udemy`. 
If you do so, you need to remember to switch between `6.10.1` vs `system` whenever you are working on
one project or the other. This is a temporary measure until 
[@udemy/sre](https://github.com/orgs/udemy/teams/sre) unifies Yarn versions across the board.</small>

Install all dependencies locally.

    $ `yarn bin`/lerna bootstrap
    
Run tests to verify everything is working.

    $ yarn run test

## Updating an existing package

1. Create a new branch.
1. Add any new dependencies to any of the packages via `lerna add`.
1. Run `lerna bootstrap` to make sure everything is installed.
1. Make your necessary source file changes.
1. Write your tests if applicable.
1. Do *NOT* update version numbers in `package.json` files (`lerna publish` does it for you).
1. Run `yarn run test` to make sure all tests pass.
1. Commit/push your changes.
1. Create a pull request against master.
1. Once your pull request is approved, merge it to master.
1. Pull latest master locally.
1. Run `lerna publish` in order to publish your changes to npm.
1. Go to the repository where you'd use these new ESLint rule changes.
1. Update the `package.json` dependencies to any `eslint-config|plugin-udemy-*` package as necessary.
1. Run `yarn install` to install the changes and to be able to start using the package.

You can always reach out to [@udemy/team-f](https://github.com/orgs/udemy/teams/team-f) on the 
[#dev-team-f Slack channel](https://udemy.slack.com/messages/dev-team-f).
 
## Adding a new package

1. Get in touch with [@udemy/team-f](https://github.com/orgs/udemy/teams/team-f) on the 
[#dev-team-f Slack channel](https://udemy.slack.com/messages/dev-team-f) to assess the need for a
new npm package to avoid any duplicate work.
1. Once there is consensus, create a new folder under [packages](packages/) folder under the
desired npm package name.
1. Use `index.js` as the package's main entry point, and `tests.js` as its entry point for tests.
1. Make sure `package.json` has the necessary information, per existing examples.
1. Make sure the new package has a meaningful `README.md` and a valid `LICENSE` file.
1. Follow the regular pull request and `lerna publish` flow as described above.

## Writing commit messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) for commit guidelines. This enables us to create a changelog for each release per package. Our commit message format is as follows:

```
Tag: Short description (fixes #1234)

Longer description here if necessary
```

The first line of the commit message (the summary) must have a specific format.

The `Tag` is one of the following:

* `Fix` - for a bug fix.
* `Update` - either for a backwards-compatible enhancement or for a rule change that adds reported problems.
* `New` - implemented a new feature.
* `Breaking` - for a backwards-incompatible enhancement or feature.
* `Docs` - changes to documentation only.
* `Build` - changes to build process only.
* `Upgrade` - for a dependency upgrade.
* `Chore` - for refactoring, adding tests, etc. (anything that isn't user-facing).

The message summary should be a one-sentence description of the change, and it must be 72 characters in length or shorter. If the pull request addresses an issue, then the issue number should be mentioned at the end. If the commit doesn't completely fix the issue, then use `(refs #1234)` instead of `(fixes #1234)`.

Here are some good commit message summary examples:

```
Build: Update Travis to only test Node 0.10 (refs #734)
Fix: Semi rule incorrectly flagging extra semicolon (fixes #840)
Upgrade: Esprima to 1.2, switch to using comment attachment (fixes #730)
```

The commit message format is important because these messages are used to create a changelog for each release. The tag and issue number help to create more consistent and useful changelogs.
